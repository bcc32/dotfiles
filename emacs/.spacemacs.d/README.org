[[help:org-agenda-files][org-agenda-files]] is computed based on the contents of =~/org=, which
should contain at least two files:

- =agenda-files=: a newline-delimited list of agenda files or
  directories (see help for [[help:org-agenda-files]]).
- =refile.org=: a default location for captures.  May be a symlink.
